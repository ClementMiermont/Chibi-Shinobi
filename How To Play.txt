Look at one of the nodes : 
- press F to fire grapple

The grapple system is based on a vector calculation, between
currently in game player position, and the node in front of camera.
When node is green, you can fire grapple. 

move :
- classic third person move
jump : 
- space

I modeled and animated each assets in the game,
but please notice that the project is still
in development. 

have fun !
